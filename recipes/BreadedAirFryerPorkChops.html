    <h2>Description</h2>

        Perfectly tender and juicy pork chops are what you'll get in just 10 minutes using your air fryer and 
        basic pantry ingredients.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) boneless, center-cut pork chops, 1-inch thick</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups cheese and garlic croutons</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place pork chops on a plate and season both sides with Cajun seasoning.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pulse croutons in a small food processor until they have a fine consistency; transfer to a shallow 
            dish. Lightly beat eggs in a separate shallow dish. Dip pork chops into eggs, letting excess drip 
            off. Coat chops in crouton breading and set on a plate. Mist chops with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray and place chops inside, making sure to not overcrowd 
            the fryer. You may have to do two batches depending on the size of your air fryer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook for 5 minutes. Flip chops and mist again with cooking spray if there are dry or powdery 
            areas. Cook 5 minutes more. Repeat with remaining chops.
        </li>
    </ol>
